# job_posting
This is the my final project for the SoftUni Python Web Framework course.

## Tech used

The project is being powered by Django Framework. 
- Django templates to send data to the end-users. 
- Bootstrap in order to make the application responsinve.

There are around 15 endpoints and most of them are handled by CBViews.


## Permisions

Anonymous users could view list of job postings, view the details page of job postings, sign-up and sign-in.

The signed-in users could do CRUD operations on the job postings, edit their profile, apply to other job postings.

New job posting categories could be added only from the administration panel.

## There are automated tests for the following functionalities:

- Sign-up
- Sign-in
- Profile
- Job Postings CRUD
